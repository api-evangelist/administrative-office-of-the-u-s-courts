      To access court records, the first step is to get an authentication token
      using your PACER username and password. The PACER Authentication API
      allows the user to authenticate automatically and without a user
      interface. This can help facilitate access for automated systems.

      federal cases or associated parties. This API uses the same search
      functionality as the PCL application and searches the same data set.
