## APIs

### PACER Authentication API
To access court records, the first step is to get an authentication token using your PACER username and password. The PACER Authentication API allows the user to authenticate automatically and without a user interface. This can help facilitate access for automated systems.

### PACER Case Locator (PCL) API
The PACER Case Locator (PCL) is a nationwide index of federal court cases. The public PCL API allows users to programmatically search the PCL for federal cases or associated parties. This API uses the same search functionality as the PCL application and searches the same data set.
